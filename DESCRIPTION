Title: Ability to register R functions and C routines as SQLite functions
Description: This provides a mechanism for users to be able to register 
  R functions and C routines as functions that can be used in SQL queries
  within SQLite.
  This can be convenient.
  Ultimately, we want to be able to compile R functions to native code and register these.
