Title: Ability to register R functions and C routines as SQLite functions
Description: This provides a mechanism for users to be able to register 
  R functions and C routines as functions that can be used in SQL queries
  within SQLite.   This can be convenient so that we can, e.g., filter records
  directly in the database without having to bring them back to R and then filter them out.
  This is very similar to what I did with Postgres and MySQL in 2000 to allow
  R functions be used as UDFs when embedded within the DBMS engine. Here, of course,
  SQLite is embedded in R.
  Ultimately, we want to be able to compile R functions to native code and register these.
